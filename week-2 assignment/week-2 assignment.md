# Week Two Assignment
Week 2 assignment is here guys! Its finally time to do some analysis. This week you'll be analysing the stocks we mentioned last week ie AAPL, GOOG, MSFT and AMZN.

## DATA:  
You will use the data for the past two years for each of the stock, you are free to use the data you downloaded last assignment or you can use yfinance to fetch the data for the past two years, the latter is preferable.

## Things to be done
* Plot the graphs for opening and closing prices as well as the volume of sales.
* Plot the moving average for each of the stock.
* Plot the daily and monthly returns for each of the stock.
* Plot a histogram (frequency-return) for daily returns. 
* Find correlation between different stocks daily returns and volume of sales.
* Plot a risk-return plot, where risk is the standard deviation of daily returns and return is the average daily return.

## Note
1. Please submit a ipynb file, and push/upload it into this folder (week-2 assignment) itself.
2. Please compartmentalize your code. Don't write a lot of code and then plot a lot of graphs, please use the fantastic "Add Cell" feature in jupyter notebook and compartmentalize your code.
3. You guys will be tested on what kind of plot you use to plot the various graphs mentioned above.
4. Feel free to use ChatGPT, but know what you've written.
5. <strong>Deadline: </strong> 6th Jan '24, 11:59pm.

Happy Coding!!!

# WIDS Stock Market Analysis + Prediction using LSTM

Welcome to the project! This project involves exploring stock market data for technology giants (Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft). We'll use yfinance to gather stock information and visualize it using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The focus is on analyzing stock risk based on past performance and predicting future prices using an Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network.

# Instructions to submit assignments

Weekly assignments would be pushed to this repository.
You are required to make a fork of this repo and push your notebooks(assignment solutions) to the respective folders within this repo.

# Resources 

## Week 1

### Aim
During Week 1, we will review Python programming and explore Numpy and Pandas.

* [Pandas Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg&t=767s) <br/>


## Week 2

### Aim
During Week 2, we will learn about matplotlib and seaborn which are python libraries used for data visualization.
### Important Links
* [Matplotlob Tutorial](https://youtu.be/3Xc3CA655Y4?feature=shared) <br/>
* [Seaborn Tutorial](https://youtu.be/6GUZXDef2U0?feature=shared) <br/>

Please code side by side on your notebooks parallely while going through the tutorials. You can use Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook.

## Week 3

### Aim
In this week, we will learn basic financial terms like Moving Average, Daily Returns and correlation between different stocks.

## Week 4

### Aim
In this week, we'll read up on RNNs and LSTM which will help us predict the future stock prices.
### Important Links
* [RNN](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/deep-learning-tutorial/rnn) <br/>
* [LSTM](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) <br/>

These will cover much of the theory you need to understand for LSTM, but we encourage you to look up how LSTM is implemented in code using scikit-learn.

The final assignment will be released soon.

# WIDS Stock Market Analysis + Prediction using LSTM

Welcome to the project! This project involves exploring stock market data for technology giants (Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft). We'll use yfinance to gather stock information and visualize it using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The focus is on analyzing stock risk based on past performance and predicting future prices using an Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network.

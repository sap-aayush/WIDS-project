# Week One Assignment

Week 1 assignment is here guys! It's time to put all you've learned to use, well not really this week you'll just be gathering the data which we have to analyse later. Since we are too lazy to provide you the dataset ourselves, we thought it would be a great exercise to let you guys do it for us and develop a much needed skill for later(Reading Documentation and Googling). Feel free to use ChatGPT but make sure you know what you've written cause you can bet we'll be testing that later.

Now coming to specifics, you need to extract the info (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close and Volume) of four tech stocks namely Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon using yfinance for the past five years and save them in .csv format. You have to create a different .csv file for each stock but all the code can be written in one jupyter notebook.

You can then push the .csv files and the jupyter notebooks to this folder on your own forks.

The data once saved should look something like this

Happy Coding!!
